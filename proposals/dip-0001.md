# DIP 1: DIP Process and Guidelines
This document describes the general format for DappSociety Improvement Proposals.

## Abstract
A DappSociety Improvement Proposal (DIP) is a design document providing information to the DappSociety community, or describing a new feature for DappSociety, its processes, or its environment. All DIPs should provide a concise specification and rationale for the proposal.

The DIP author/owner is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

We intend DIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into DappSociety.

Because DIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the proposal.

## DIP Types
There are three types of DIPs:

* __Process DIPs__ describe processes, or propose changes to processes, used within DappSociety. They often require community consensus and are more than recommendations. Ignoring them is frowned upon. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, changes to organizational structure, and changes to the tools or environment used within the community. Any Meta DIP is also considered a Process DIP.

* __Code DIPs__ describe changes or additions to any DappSociety code implementations. Examples include changes to the Token Reward Contracts, the Governance Contracts, and any future code used within the community.

* __Information DIPs__ describe DappSociety design issues, or provide general guidelines or information to the DappSociety community. They do not propose new features or processes. Informational DIPs do not necessarily represent community consensus, so users and implementors are free to ignore them or follow their advice.

## DIP Work Flow
The DIP process begins with a new idea for DappSociety. It is highly recommended that a single DIP contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the DIP, the more successful it tends to be. If in doubt, split your DIP into several well-focused ones.

Each potential DIP must have a champion: someone who writes the DIP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The DIP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is DIP-able.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a DIP is meant to save both the potential author and the wider community time. Asking the DappSociety community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions. It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most DappSociety members.

Examples of appropriate public forums to gauge interest around your DIP include the [DappSociety subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dappsociety), the [Issues section of this repository](https://github.com/DappSociety/DIPs/issues/), and one of the [DappSociety Slack](https://dappsociety.slack.com/) channels. In particular, the Issues section of this repository is an excellent place to discuss your proposal with the community and start creating more formalized language around your DIP.

Once the champion has asked the DappSociety community whether an idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft DIP should be presented as a pull request. This gives the author a chance to continuously edit the draft for proper formatting and quality. This also allows for further public comment and the author of the DIP to address concerns about the proposal.

Authors *must not* self-assign DIP numbers, but should use an alias such as `dip-username-proposal_name.md` which includes the author's username and the DIP subject.

If the DIP collaborators approve, a DIP editor will assign the DIP a number (generally the next number in the sequence), label it, give it status "Draft", and add it to the Git repository. The DIP editors will not unreasonably deny a DIP. Reasons for denying DIP status include duplication of effort, disregard for formatting rules, being too unfocused or too broad, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not keeping with the DappSociety philosophy.

For a DIP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate any system unduly.

The DIP author may update the Draft as necessary in the Git repository. Updates to drafts may also be submitted by the author as pull requests.

### DIP Statuses
The typical paths of the status of DIPs are as follows:

![BIP Paths](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/raw/master/bip-0002/process.png)

Champions of a DIP may decide on their own to change the status between Draft, Deferred, or Withdrawn. The DIP editor may also change the status to Deferred when no progress is being made.

A DIP can also be Rejected. Perhaps after all is said and done it was not a good idea. It is still important to have a record of this fact.

A DIP may only change status from Draft (or Rejected) to Proposed when the author deems it is complete, has a working implementation (where applicable), and has community plans to progress it to the Final status.

DIPs should be changed from Draft or Proposed status to Rejected status upon request by any person if they have not made progress in one year. Such a DIP may be changed to Draft status if the champion provides revisions that meaningfully address public criticism of the proposal, or to Proposed status if it meets the criteria required as described in the previous paragraph.

A Proposed DIP may progress to Final only when specific criteria reflecting real-world adoption has occurred. This is different for each DIP depending on the nature of its proposed changes. Evaluation of this status change should be objectively verifiable, and/or be discussed within the DappSociety Slack.

When a Final DIP is no longer relevant, its status may be changed to Replaced or Obsolete (which is equivalent to Replaced). This change must also be objectively verifiable and/or discussed.

A process DIP may change status from Draft to Active when it achieves rough consensus within the DappSociety Slack. Such a proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion for at least one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be given in such circumstances.

Some Informational and Process DIPs may also have a status of Active if they are never meant to be completed. E.g. DIP 1 (this DIP).

Once a DIP has been accepted, the implementations must be completed. When the implementation is complete and accepted by the community, the status will be changed to "Final".

## DIP Formats and Templates
DIPs should be written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) format. Image files should be included in a subdirectory.

To get started, you can use [this template](https://github.com/DappSociety/DIPs/blob/master/dip-xxxx.md).

### What Belongs in a Successful DIP?
Each DIP should have all or some of the following parts:

* Preamble - RFC 822 style headers containing metadata about the DIP, including the DIP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the contact info for each author.

* Simple Summary - "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the DIP.

* Abstract - A short (~200 word) description of the issue being addressed.

* Motivation - The motivation is critical for DIPs that want to change DappSociety. It should clearly explain why the existing specification is inadequate to address the problem that the DIP solves. DIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

* Specification - Describe how, in detail, how this proposal will actually be implemented. Technical specifications should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

* Rationale - The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related examples. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

* Backwards Compatibility - All DIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The DIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. DIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

* Test Cases - Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for DIPs that are affecting code. Other DIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

* Implementations - The implementations must be completed before any DIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the DIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.

* Copyright Waiver - All DIPs must be in public domain. See the bottom of this DIP for an example copyright waiver.

### DIP Header Preamble
Each DIP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with "\*" are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

```
DIP: <DIP number, or <to be assigned>>
Title: <DIP title>
Author: <list of authors' names and email addresses>
* Discussions-To: <email address or link>
Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
         Withdrawn | Final | Replaced>
Type: <Process | Code | Information>
Created: <date created, in yyyy-mm-dd format>, <date last updated>
* Requires: <DIP number(s)>
* Replaces: <DIP number>
* Replaced-By: <DIP number>
```

The Author header lists the names and email addresses of all the authors/owners of the DIP. The format of the Author header value must be

    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>

While a DIP is in private discussions (usually during the initial Draft phase), a Discussions-To header will indicate the mailing list or URL where the DIP is being discussed. No Discussions-To header is necessary if the DIP is being discussed privately with the author.

The Type header specifies the type of DIP: Process, Code, or Information.

The Created header records the date that the DIP was first published, followed by when it was last updated. Headers should be in `yyyy-mm-dd` format.

DIPs may have a Requires header, indicating the DIP numbers that this DIP depends on.

DIPs may also have a Replaced-By header indicating that a DIP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the DIP that replaces the current document. The newer DIP must have a Replaces header containing the number of the DIP that it rendered obsolete.

### Auxiliary Files
DIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Such files should be included in a subdirectory for that DIP and must be named `dip-XXXX-Y.ext`, where "XXXX" is the DIP number, "Y" is a serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. "png"). If you DIP has not yet been assigned a number, use the temporary file name you gave it, e.g. `dip-username-proposal_name-Y.ext`.

## Transferring DIP Ownership
It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of DIPs to a new champion. In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred DIP, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the DIP process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the DIP. We try to build consensus around a DIP, but if that's not possible, you can always submit a competing DIP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a DIP, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the DIP editor. If the original author doesn't respond to email in a timely manner, the DIP editor will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed).

## DIP Editors
The current DIP editors are

We are in need of additional DIP editors. If you would like to volunteer to be one, please contact @BlockchainBud via Slack or simply add yourself to the list here.

### DIP Editor Responsibilities and Workflow
For each new DIP that comes in, an editor does the following:

* Reads the DIP to check if it is ready, sound, and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be accepted.
* Makes sure title should accurately describes the content.
* Edits the DIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (Github flavored Markdown), and code style.

If the DIP isn't ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

Once the DIP is ready for the repository, the editor will:

* Assign a DIP number (almost always just the next available number) in the pull request comments.
* Merge the pull request when the author is ready (allowing some time for further peer review).
* List the DIP in [README.md](https://github.com/DappSociety/DIPs/blob/master/README.md)
* Send a message back to the DIP author with next steps.

The DIP editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial responsibilities. The DIP editors monitor DIP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.

The editors don't pass judgment on DIPs. We merely do the administrative & editorial part.

## History
This document was derived heavily from [Ethereum's EIP-1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md) written by Martin Becze, [Bitcoin's BIP-0002](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki) written by Luke Dashjr, and [Bitcoin's BIP-0001](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0001.mediawiki) written by Amir Taaki which in turn was derived from Python's PEP-0001. In many places text was simply copied and modified. Although the PEP-0001 text was written by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger, they are not responsible for its use in the DappSociety Improvement Proposals, and should not be bothered with technical questions specific to DappSociety or the DIP. Please direct all comments to the DIP editors.
