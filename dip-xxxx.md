# DIP X: Title
Enter the DIP title into the heading and add a short summary here. "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the DIP.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the issue being addressed.

## Motivation
The motivation is critical for DIPs that want to change DappSociety. It should clearly explain why the existing specification is inadequate to address the problem that the DIP solves. DIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification
Describe how, in detail, how this proposal will actually be implemented. Technical specifications should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related examples. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Backwards Compatibility
All DIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The DIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. DIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for DIPs that are affecting code. Other DIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Implementation
The implementations must be completed before any DIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the DIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
